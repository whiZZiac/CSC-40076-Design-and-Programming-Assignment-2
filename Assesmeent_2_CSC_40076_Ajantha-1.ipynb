It is designed to help developers test the email sending functionality of applications without the need to connect to an actual SMTP server or a network, which simplifies debugging and testing by containing all operations locally. Also avoiding unnecessary network activity and the risks of sending unintended emails during testing.\n",
    "Testing with actual servers may cause havoc as those messages will be detected as spam, a waste of network resources, and cause additional traffic in the network. There are third-party companies that provide dummy SMTP servers for developers.\n",

    "### **member_return_book(self, member_id: str, book_number: str, dummy_smtp_server: DummySMTPServer) -> float**\n",
    "Handles the process of a library member returning a borrowed book. This method ensures that the book was actually borrowed by the member, updates its availability, calculates any fines due to late returns, manages any reservations, and sends necessary notifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters:\n",
    "- **member_id (str)**: the member ID, returning the book.\n",
    "- **book_number (str)**: The number of the book being returned.\n",
    "- **dummy_smtp_server (DummySMTPServer)**: A dummy SMTP server instance used for sending notifications without actual network activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Returns:\n",
    "- **float**: The amount of total fines the member accrued, if any, or zero if no fines are due. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process:\n",
    "1. **Member and Book Validation**:\n",
    "   It confirms that:\n",
    "   - the member exists in the library's records.\n",
    "   - the book exists within the library's catalog.\n",
    "   - The book was actually borrowed by the member.\n",
    "    If any of the checks fail, it returns a fine of zero and logs an appropriate error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Book Return Processing**:\n",
    "   - Changes the status of the book as 'available'.\n",
    "   - Removes the book from the member's list of borrowed books.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fine Calculation**:\n",
    "   - Calculates any fines due based on the late return of the book using the member's **calculate_fines** method. (It calculates the total fine, not limited this return)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Reservation Management**:\n",
    "   - Manages the reservation queue for the returned book. If the book is reserved, it notifies the next member in line that the book is now available using the provided dummy SMTP server.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Remar**:\n",
    "   - Logs the return event, including the member's name, the book title, and any fines charged.\n",
    "   - Updates the library's JSON files to reflect the changes made during the return process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process Flow:\n",
    "- When a member attempts to reserve a book, the system first checks if the book is available.\n",
    "- If available, the book is borrowed directly, bypassing the reservation system.\n",
    "- If unavailable, the member is added to the book's reservation queue.\n",
    "- Periodically, the system checks books with reservations to see if they have become available:\n",
    "- If a book is available, the system notifies the next member in the queue using the dummy SMTP server.\n",
    "- The notified member can then proceed to borrow the book. (The procedure triggers to be completed automatically simultaneously)\n",

    "### **manage_reservations_and_notifications(self, book_number, dummy_smtp_server)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This method oversees the management of the reservation queue for a book being returned to the library and ensures timely notifications are sent to members awaiting the availability of that book.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters:\n",
    "- **book_number (str)**: The identifier for the book that is being returned and which might have pending reservations.\n",
    "- **dummy_smtp_server (DummySMTPServer)**: A simulated SMTP server used for sending out notification emails in a test environment without actual email dispatch.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process:\n",
    "1. **Check Reservations**:\n",
    "   - The method first checks if the returned book has any pending reservations by looking up its book number in the `reserved_books` dictionary.\n",
    "   - If there are reservations, the method retrieves the ID of the next member in line (i.e., the first member in the reservation queue).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Send Notifications**:\n",
    "   - If a member is waiting for the book, a notification email is constructed and sent through the provided dummy SMTP server. This email informs the member that the book is now available for pickup or borrowing.\n",
    "   - The notification details include the member's email address and a custom message about the availability of the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Manage Reservation Queue**:\n",
    "   - After sending the notification, the method updates the reservation queue by removing the notified member's ID.\n",
    "   - If there are no more members in the queue, a message is printed to the console indicating that there are no further reservations for the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Update Library Catalog**:\n",
    "   - Regardless of the reservation status, the returned book is added back to the library's shelf, making it available for borrowing again.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Persistence**:\n",
    "   - Updates are made to the library's JSON files to reflect the changes in the book's availability and the reservation queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Side Effects:\n",
    "- **Console Output**:\n",
    "  - The method outputs various messages to the console to provide real-time feedback on the actions being taken, such as successful notification delivery and the status of the reservation queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remarks:\n",
    "- This method ensures the library maintains a fair and efficient system for book reservations, enhancing user satisfaction by promptly notifying members about book availability.\n",
    "- It relies heavily on the accurate functioning of the **find_member_details** method to fetch the necessary member details for notifications.\n",

    "\n",
    "This method manages the process of reserving a book in the library, ensuring proper handling of book availability and member eligibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters:\n",
    "- **member_id (str)**: The ID of the member attempting to reserve the book.\n",
    "- **book_number (str)**: The identifier for the book being reserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process:\n",
    "1. **Validation Checks**:\n",
    "   - The method first verifies the existence of both the book and the member using their respective IDs. If either is not found in the library's records, it returns **False** and prints an error message indicating the missing book or member.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Direct Borrowing**:\n",
    "   - If the book is available and not currently reserved by any member, it allows the member to borrow the book directly. This is reflected by setting the book's availability to **False** and adding the book to the member's list of borrowed books. A message is printed to confirm the borrowing, and the library's JSON files are updated to reflect this change.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handle Existing Reservations**:\n",
    "   - If the book is already reserved, the method checks if the current member is attempting to reserve it again. If so, it returns **False** and informs the user that the book has already been reserved by them.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Queue Management**:\n",
    "   - If the book is unavailable due to existing reservations, the member's ID is added to the reservation queue unless they are already in the queue. The queue ensures that members are notified in the order they requested the book once it becomes available again.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Confirmation**:\n",
    "   - After successfully adding the member to the reservation queue, the method prints a confirmation message stating that the book has been reserved by the member.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Returns:\n",
    "- **bool**: Returns **True** if the book is successfully reserved or borrowed directly by the member; otherwise, returns **False**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Remarks:\n",
    "- This method is critical for managing book circulation within the library, ensuring fair access to resources and maintaining order in the reservation process. It directly interacts with the library's JSON files to keep the system's state consistent with real-world changes.\n",

    "* Member Portal Integration: Develop an online portal where members can view their loan history, fines, and manage reservations.\n",
    "This class serves as the backbone of a library management system, centralizing the management of library resources, member activities and tasks, thereby facilitating efficient library operations. This can be offered through Apps too.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Priority-Based Reservations based on specific criteria such as membership level (e.g., premium members get higher priority, academic priorities for students or researchers for academic materials), or by the frequency of library usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implement dynamic reservation windows where a limited reservation time before picking up a book based on demand or historical data about how quickly books in certain categories are picked up.\n",
    "   \n",
    "* Reservation Limits for members where a member can have at one time for popular resources. It can be again controlled by different levels of membership tires.\n",
    "   \n",
    "* Use data analytics to predict high-demand periods or titles to adjust reservation allowances, number of materials by increasing stocks or rotating among different libraries to a more robust dynamic rotation to save time.\n",

If it is late, you can calculate the fine and notify the member of the late return and the amount of the fine.\n",

    "To improve the extensibility of your notification system, you can consider decoupling the notification logic from the main library class. Instead of hardcoding the notification behavior directly into the library methods, you can create a separate notification service or class that handles all notifications. This way, if you need to add more notification types or change the notification behavior in the future, you can do so without modifying the library class itself. Additionally, using a separate notification service allows you to easily switch between different notification methods (e.g., email, SMS, push notification) or integrate with external notification services.\n",

The *'member_number'* is unique, which is a sequenced number field in our dataset. When reissuing, it always be unique to the same member as the prefix is the unique member number and the suffix is the issue number. The suffix is auto-incremental and not hard-coded to have a risk of making duplicates. Also a condition is checked if the same details try to regeister twice.\n",

    " ***Note:*** we are not looking into removing members from the library as a requirement of this assessment. If we remove a member, there are scenarios to be considered: If we have to maintain the integrity and simplicity of the data structure it is not recommended to remove altogether the member ID instead a suggestion is to leave the member as 'inactive' status or delete and replace it with 'deleted_member' default data pre-defined. This is to maintain the integrity, unique number scheme, and easy auto incrementation of assigning numbers to new members. With GDPR laws, stakeholders' preferences, or member preferences, it could be decided if to retain the member details for a limited time, remove them from the database, or keep them forever. We are not looking into this in detail as it is not a requirement of this assessment. This could be a future development idea.\n",

    "- As it is not a requirement of the assessment I am not reissuing a new card to every single card member in the dataset where the membership card is '0'.\n",
    "- It can be done through an iteration of the data field and creating a list of all the members whose membership is '0'—then calling the *'function reissue_membership_card_to_members(reissue_member_ids)'* to reissue a new card. I am not carrying out that exercise but it is shown as an example case scenario with members to show the functionality of the project.\n",

Currently, the calculation is strictly based on total fines based on virtual returned dates. This is a major flow of fine calculations here as not taking into account if any particular book was borrowed and late within the project. (saving the JSON file into the hard disk is important in such a scenario.)\n",

    "#### **System specific future developments:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notifications:**\n",
    "* To improve the extensibility of the notification system, it is suggested to consider decoupling the notification logic from the main library class. Instead of hardcoding the notification behavior directly into the library methods, could be created a separate notification service or class that handles all notifications.\n",
    "* This way, if I need to add more notification types or change the notification behavior in the future, it is easier do so without modifying the library class itself.\n",
    "* Additionally, using a separate notification service allows to easily switch between different notification methods (e.g., email, SMS, push notification) or integrate with external notification services.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A Notification class:**  This class will be responsible for handling all notifications.\n",
    "* **Separate Notification Service:** Instead of embedding notification logic directly into the library class, create a separate notification service or class.\n",
    "* **Dependency Injection:** The library class should not be directly responsible for sending notifications. Instead, it should rely on the notification service to handle notifications. This can be achieved through dependency injection, where the library class accepts an instance of the notification service as a parameter.\n",
    "* **Interface or Abstract Class:** Define an interface or abstract class for the notification service. This allows to define a contract that all notification services must adhere to. For example, define methods like \"send_email_notification\", \"send_sms_notification\", etc.\n",
    "* **Flexible Configuration:** Make the notification service configurable so that you can easily switch between different notification methods or integrate with external notification services. This can be done through configuration settings or by using a factory pattern to create instances of varying notification services based on configuration.\n",
    "* **Lookup Method:** Implement a lookup mechanism to determine which notification method to use for each event. This could involve looking up configuration settings, user preferences, or other criteria to determine the appropriate notification method for each event.\n",
    "* **.JSON** Creating another json file to collect members' reservation information is another method (as specified by this assessment). Creating a .json file to store members' information with the book number, and queue number for that particular book can be prioritized whom to issue the book when the book is available. Once issue a book change the prioritising number order again from 1. Is a simple process which helps again to decouple with classes and increase the extensibility and flexibility. \n",
    "  \n",
    "By decoupling the notification logic from the main library class and following these principles, the system will be more flexible, maintainable, and extensible. Easily could be added new notification methods, switch between different notification services, and adapt to changing requirements without having to modify the core library functionality. Additionally, this approach allows for easier testing and integration with external systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Payments:** I have not completed the payments, paying off until the debts are cleared or an accounting system. I have started some payment methods, but it is better to have a separate class again for the payments and it is not a requirement in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Software architectural and system modifications for Future:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Automated Testing:** This could involve unit tests for individual methods and integration tests that simulate user interactions with the system. At the initial stages, I implemented that method of user interaction but ditched it due to not being in the scope of this project. Testing frameworks like \"unittest\" in Python can be quite effective for this.\n",
    "* **Data Validation:** To ensure that the data input into the system is validated both format-wise and logically. This includes checking that emails are in a valid format, names contain appropriate characters, and member IDs are unique and correctly formatted. Again this is not tested in this project.\n",
    "* **Error Handling:** Continue to refine error handling strategies to manage unexpected input and system states gracefully. Proper error handling can prevent the application from crashing and provide users with helpful error messages.\n",
    "* **Logging:** Implement logging to keep track of operations, especially those that modify data. This can help in diagnosing problems after they occur and in understanding the behavior of the system during testing and deployment.\n",
    "* **Performance Optimization:** As the library grows, keep an eye on the performance of the operations, particularly those that iterate over large datasets like members or books. Optimization may involve refining algorithms or utilizing more efficient data structures.\n",
    "* **User Interface:** If the application will have a user interface, start planning how users will interact with it. The functionality needs to be accessible and user-friendly, with clear navigation and input validation. Flow diagram could be helpful.\n",
    "* **Security Measures:** If the system will eventually handle real user data, consider security implications, including data encryption for storage and secure communication protocols if there is a network component and multi-level user access privileges.\n",
    "* **Documentation:** Continue documenting the code and its usage. Good documentation can be invaluable for maintenance, future development, and other developers who may work with the code.\n",
    "* **Backup and Recovery:** Implement strategies for data backup and recovery to protect against data loss. Regular backups and a clear plan for restoring data after a loss can mitigate the impact of system failures. Using reputed cloud storage is an option.\n",
    "* **Continuous Improvement:** Even with the system functioning as expected now, software development is an iterative process. Keep refining, testing, and improving the system based on user feedback and as new requirements emerge.\n",
